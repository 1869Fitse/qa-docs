 #test incident report includes
  -how to reproduce the fault
  -test environment details
  -severity, priority
  -the actual and expected outcomes
 #part of configuration management:

  -status accounting of configuration items
  -identification of test versions
  -record of changes to documentation over time
  -controlled library access
 #Error guessing is best used after more formal techniques have been applied
 #IEEE 829 test plan documentation standard contains all of the following 

   test items
   test deliverables
   test tasks
   test environment

  #The place to start if you want a (new) test tool is: Analyse your needs and requirements

  #The standard that gives definitions of testing terms is:
   BS7925-1

  #Test Plan document of the Test Documentation Standard includes

   Test items (i.e. software versions)
   What is not to be tested
   Test environments
   Schedules and deadlines

  #A typical commercial test execution tool would be able to perform 
                       :
    replaying inputs according to a programmed script
    comparison of expected outcomes with actual outcomes
    recording test inputs
    reading test values from a data file

  #white box design techniques all have an associated measurement technique
   cyclomatic complexity is not a test measurement technique
   black box measurement techniques all have an associated test design technique
   white box measurement techniques all have an associated test design technique

  #(false)black box design techniques all have an associated measurement technique
 
  #Beta testing is:Performed by customers at their own site
 
  #i. static analysis
  ii. performance testing
  iii. test management
  iv. dynamic analysis
  v. test running
  vi. test data preparation
      developers would typically use i and iv; test team ii, iii, v and vi

   #The main purpose of the integration strategy for integration testing in the small is
     to specify which modules to combine when and how many at once 

   #When a new testing tool is purchased, it should be used first by:A small team to 
     establish the best way to use the tool

   #A tool that supports traceability, recording of incidents or scheduling of tests is called
    a configuration management tool

   #Test managers should:

      report on deviations from the project plan
      sign the system off for release
      raise incidents on faults that they have found
      provide information for risk analysis and quality improvement

   #static analysis can find

     The use of a variable before it has been defined
     Unreachable (“dead”) code
     The re-definition of a variable before it has been used
     Array bound violations

   #black box techniques

     Equivalence partitioning
     State transition testing
     Syntax testing
     Boundary value analysis
   #Regression testing should be performed:

    1) after the software has changed
    2) when the environment has changed

   #.i.early test design can prevent fault multiplication
   iii. early test design can find faults
    iv. early test design can cause changes to the requirements
   
   #When what is visible to end-users is a deviation from the specific or expected behavior, this is called:
    a failure

   #characteristics or review processes:

 1. walkthrough led by author
 2. informal review undocumented
 3. peer review no management participation
 4. inspection led by a trained moderator or leader
 5. inspection uses entry exit criteria
   
   #inspection is the most formal review process
    inspections should be led by a trained leader
    managers can perform inspections on management documents
    inspection compares documents with predecessor (source) documents
   # system testing:

     business process-based testing
     performance, load and stress testing
     requirements-based testing
     usability testing

    #top-down integration testing is not a system testing
     
    #he main focus of acceptance testing is testing for a business perspective
    
    #the purpose of test completion criteria in a test plan is to plan when to stop testing
    #Unreachable code would best be found usingis code reviews
    
    ?statement coverage vs branch coverage
    ?Deliverable base-lining
    ?McCabe’s Cyclomatic Complexity 
    ?Logic coverage is:
    ?Statement Coverage
    ?pole Coverage
    ?Condition Coverage
    ?Path Coverage


  #Component testing should be performed by development
   Component testing is also know as isolation or module testing
   Component testing should have completion criteria planned
   Component testing  involve regression testing
  # reasons for a failure
    1) Testing fault
    2) Software fault
    3) Design fault
    4) Environment Fault
    5) Documentation Fault

  #capture-replay tools
     are used to support multi-user testing
     are the most frequently purchased types of CAST tool
     are ised to capture aspects of user behaviour

  #characteristic for Testability?
    Operability
    Observability
    Simplicity
  #During the software development process, at what point can the test process start?   
     When the software requirements have been approved
  # part of a test plan?

    Features to be tested
    Risks
    Schedule

  #an objective for a test?
    To find faults in the software
    To assess whether the software is ready for release
    To demonstrate that the software doesn’t work
  #tools would be involved in the automation of regression test are

     1899,1900,2004,2005

  #To test a function, the programmer has to write a _driver_, which calls the function and passes it test data

  # regression test:Will help ensure unchanged areas of the software have not been affected
  #debugging is not a part of fundamentals of testing
  # fundamentals of testing-> test planning and control
                           -> analysis and design
                           -> implementation and execution
                           -> evaluating exit criteria and reporting
                           -> test closure
 # 7 principle of testing
 # a system is not always reliable after debugging since it can cause more bug
 # principle 3- early testing
 # principle 4 -defect clustering-> a small number of modules usually contains most od 
                                    the defects discovered during prerelease testing, or responsible for 
                                    most of the operational faliure

  #Incidents may be raised against user requirements
   Incidents require investigation and/or correction
   Incidents are raised when expected and actual results differ

  #The biggest potential cost saving from the use of CAST is Test execution

  #Statement Coverage will  check for the following.
   Unused Branches
   Dead Code
   Unused Statement
 ,but does not check missing statements

  #Independent Verification & Validation is Done by an Entity Outside the Project’s sphere of influence

  #How much testing is enough?
  The answer depends on the risk for your industry, contract and special requirements
  
  #The best definition of quality is Conformance to requirements

  #Test cases are designed during: test specification


  #Boundary value testing tests boundary conditions on, below and above the edges of input and output 
  equivalence classes

  #Equivalence partitioning is:
  A black box testing technique appropriate to all levels of testing

  #Fault Masking is Error condition hiding another error condition
  
  #Acceptance test cases are based on Requirements
 
  #In a review meeting a moderator is a person who Mediates between people

  #A common test technique during component test is Statement and branch testing
  
  #Defect Management process include
        Defect prevention
        Management reporting

  #Tests are prioritized so that:You do the best testing in the time available
  
  #The oracle assumption:is that the tester can routinely identify the correct outcome of a test

  # A quality characteristic listed in ISO 9126 Standard are
      Functionality
      Usability
      Maintainability
  
  #Inspections can find all the following :
    Variables not defined in the code
    Spelling and grammar faults in the documents
    Requirements that have been omitted from the design documents

  #Inspections cannot find How much of the code has been covered

  #If an expected result is not specified it may be difficult to determine if the test has passed or failed

  #Code Coverage is used as a measure Test Effectiveness

  #One Key reason why developers have difficulty testing their own work is:Lack of Objectivity

  #static testing techniques are
   Walkthrough
   Data flow analysis
   Inspections

  #The inputs for developing a test plan are taken from aProject plan
